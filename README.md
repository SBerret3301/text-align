Explanation:

1. `h1`: This CSS selector targets the first `h1` element on the page and applies a style to center-align its text.

2. `h1 + h1`: This CSS selector targets the second `h1` element that directly follows another `h1` element. It applies a style to left-align the text of this second heading.

3. `h1 + h1 + h1`: This CSS selector targets the third `h1` element that directly follows two other `h1` elements. It applies a style to right-align the text of this third heading.

The HTML document contains three headings with different text alignments and a paragraph with Lorem Ipsum text. The applied styles in the CSS section add visual enhancements to the headings based on their positions in the document, creating a varied text alignment for each heading. The comments in the code provide explanations for each section.
